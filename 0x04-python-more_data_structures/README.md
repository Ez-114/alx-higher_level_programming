# 0x04-python-more_data_structures    

In this project I have learned and solved tasks about:    
- sets    
- dictionaries    
- lambda functions    
- map functions    
- filter functions    
- reduce functions    

There are some QAs that I've answered about these topics    

## What are sets and how to use them?    

Sets are unordered collections with no duplicates, and their basic uses include:     
- membership testing    
- eliminating duplicate series    

Python sets support mathematical operations like Union, Intersection, Difference, and Symmetric Difference.    
Sets have methods like any sequential python datatype.    

### How to make sets?    

Use `{}` or `set()` function to create sets, however, if you want to init an empty set you should use the function only, becaues the empty curly brackets are used to init empty dicts.   
	**i.e.** `basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'oragne'}`    
	This will output -> `{'apple', 'orange', 'pear'}`     

### Sets Operations    

- `a - b` -> gives what in a but not in b   
- `a | b` -> gives what is in a or b or both    
- `a & b` -> gives what is common between a and b only    
- `a ^ b` -> gives what is in a or b but not both    

## When to use Sets V.S. Lists?    

The primary difference between list and set is that a list allows duplicate elements and maintains their order, while a set ensures element uniqueness without any guaranteed order.    
So, if you're wondering which to use, it depends on the use case. 
If you donâ€™t want the values in the data to change, you can use a set. 
But if you want the items to change, you can use a list. 
You can also take into account whether the order of the items matters to you or not.    

## What are dictionaries and how to use them?    

Dictionaries are similar to arrays some how, but you can access their elements using keys (not index). 
Dicts are set of `key : value` pairs, and keys must have unique values. 
You can store a value with some key and extract it again using its given key. 
To construct a dict you can use the `dict()` function or just put `{}`.
